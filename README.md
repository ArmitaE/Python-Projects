### [Sudoku Solver](Sudoku/)

The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

### [Snake](Snake/)

This challenge consists of using Python turtle library and random library to create a program where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle.

### [Clock with Turtle](Clock/clock.py)

This challenge consists of using Python turtle library and time library to create a program that displays the current time as an anlogue clock.

### [Pascal's triangle](Pascal's_triangle/pascal.py)

In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. The rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row n = 0 at the top (the 0th row). The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with k = 0 and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows. The triangle may be constructed in the following manner: In row 0 (the topmost row), there is a unique nonzero entry 1. Each entry of each subsequent row is constructed by adding the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right, treating blank entries as 0. For example, the initial number in the first (or any other) row is 1 (the sum of 0 and 1), whereas the numbers 1 and 3 in the third row are added to produce the number 4 in the fourth row.

### [Factorial](Factorial/factorial.py)

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
