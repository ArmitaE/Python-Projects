# Clock

This challenge consists of using Python turtle library and time library to create a program that displays the current time as an anlogue clock.

## Description

A clock is an instrument to measure, keep, and indicate time. The standard clock face, known universally throughout the world, has a short "hour hand" which indicates the hour on a circular dial of 12 hours, making two revolutions per day, and a longer "minute hand" which indicates the minutes in the current hour on the same dial, which is also divided into 60 minutes. It may also have a "second hand" which indicates the seconds in the current minute.
