## [Linear Search](./linear_search.py)

Linear search is rarely used practically because other search algorithms allow significantly faster searching.

## [Fibonacci](./fibonacci.py)  
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.
` 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...`

## [Exponentiation](./power.py)  
Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written as b<sup>n</sup>, involving two numbers, the base b and the exponent n. When n is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, b<sup>n</sup> is the product of multiplying n bases.

## [Binary Search](./binary.py)
In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.

## [Tower of Hanoi](./hanoi.py)
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.
