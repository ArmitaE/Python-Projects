## [Linear Search](./linear_search.py)

Linear search is rarely used practically because other search algorithms allow significantly faster searching.

## [Fibonacci](./fibonacci.py)  
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.
` 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...`

## [Exponentiation](./power.py)  
Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written as b<sup>n</sup>, involving two numbers, the base b and the exponent n. When n is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, b<sup>n</sup> is the product of multiplying n bases.

## [Binary Search](./binary.py)
In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.
